# SimpleTextEditor

The main idea was to create WYSIWYG editor with extendable actions.
Current version contains bold/italic/underline, indent/outdent, color and synonyms search actions.

# Task

## Intro
Imagine that you are involved into development of a data knowledge storing system, like Wiki or Confluence. At some point you need providing users with possibility of advanced text formatting. For this purpose it was decided to build an own component, in order to have possibilities customizing its functionality in the future.

## Requirements
The goal is to implement a component, which renders text and has several features for text manipulation and formatting.

## Must have
We need to see your own code. It is not permitted to apply and configure a ready-to-use component for text formatting. We need to see your own solution. However you can use other handy components and libraries.
User should be able to interact with words of text by some action like double-click or some other way, to select a word. When the word is selected, the user should have possibility to apply options for this word. For simplification we expect to select separate words only; it is not expected to support selection for a part of text.
Minimal required formatting list is Bold, Italic and Underline.
Formatting settings should be persisted into an in-memory model. When the user selects formatted word, the component should indicate, what formatting options are applied. So then a repetetive formatting application removes these styles (i.e. click bold-botton - get bold text, click bold-botton again - return text weight to normal). It should be possible to apply Bold, Italic and Underline to a word at the same time.
Besides formatting options, the user should be able to see synonyms for any word. For getting synonyms use https://www.datamuse.com/api/. Synonyms loading should be implemented out of the component and provided into the component in some way.
User should be able to replace a word with a synonym, while keeping all formatting settings.
The solution must be flexible and extendable, so new functionality can be added in the future.
Target completion time is 2 hours. We would rather see what you were able to do in 2 hours, than a full-blown solution youâ€™ve spent days implementing. Note that in addition to quality, time used is also factored into scoring the task.
## Nice to have
The editor accepts text input, rather than works with a predefined block of text.
Word formatting should be extended by color setting.
It should be possible to do indentation for a block of text to one or several steps (i.e. tabulation). Take a look to Gmail editor to get the idea.
## Expected Deliverables
Source code.
Readme, with instructions, how to launch your application.

# 1) Installation

Run `yarn install` in terminal

# 2) Development server

Run `nps serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
